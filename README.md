Problem statement 
  Employing and retaining the right people to carry out government functions are critical elements to ensure Baltimore City Government      provides the best services to their citizens. We suspect that non optimal efficiency in any given agency is partially due to position vacancies and employee turnover, however, we donâ€™t have a good grasp on which specific positions are difficult to fill, why it might be challenging to retain employees, and how government fairs against other industries in competing types of positions. What does the past 7 years of employee data tell us about this, and which agencies and positions are most at risk for employee high turnover rates?
Our Approach and Analysis
  We wanted to look at turnover rate/retention rate in different periods. Some initial guiding questions: What is Baltimore city's turnover 
  rate? What is the turnover rate per department over time? Does turnover vary by season? Are their specific jobs that show extremely high   turnover? For specific jobs and departments, how do we compare to industry standards?
Outside research
