# Who’s in and who’s out: Tackling how Baltimore City Government can retain its best talent 

**What is the challenge faced by Baltimore City Government?**
Baltimore City Government's Bureau of Budget Management and Research suspects that "non-optimal efficiency in any given agency is partially due to position vacancies and employee turnover." However, there is a *lack of clarity on which positions or agencies are especially prone to vacancies or turnover.* 

**Why does this issue matter?**
The ability for Baltimore City Government to provide quality service to its citizens depends on recruiting and retaining the right employees to perform crucial government functions. Hence, identifying the worst-performing departments in vacancies and turnover will:
* help the government _prioritize its limited resources and budget_ towards improving employee retention; 
* _reduce loss-of-productivity costs_ due to vacancies by concentrating efforts on departments with high vacancy rates;
* maximize retention of employees in departments with high turnover rates, which _reduces costs associated with recruiting and training_;
* directly address where brain drain and loss of talent hits city government agencies the hardest and consequently _raise the quality of service_ that it delivers to Baltimore residents by retaining top talent and 'know-how'.

# High-Level Findings & Suggestions

Compared to the national metrics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for state and local governments, excluding education, Baltimore City Government consistently has a net loss of employees whereas the national trend is to gain employees.

Our findings identified the top worst performing departments as the **Office of Criminal Justice, Office of Inspector General**, and the **Office of Civil Rights** by turnover and vacancy rates. The **Police, Public Works, and Health** departments also indicated high numbers of vacancy and frequently had more than 1 person occupy a given position during one fiscal year.
Additionally, we noticed a correlation between frequent leadership changes and high employee turnover within agencies. 

Based on these findings, our recommendations would be to focus efforts on retaining leaders and cultivating a culture of dedication/loyalty to the departments rather than to the department head.
