# Who’s in and who’s out: Tackling how Baltimore City Government can retain its best talent 

**What is the challenge faced by Baltimore City Government?**
Baltimore City Government's Bureau of Budget Management and Research suspects that "non-optimal efficiency in any given agency is partially due to position vacancies and employee turnover." However, there is a *lack of clarity on which positions or agencies are especially prone to vacancies or turnover.* 

**Why does this issue matter?**
The ability for Baltimore City Government to provide quality service to its citizens depends on recruiting and retaining the right employees to perform crucial government functions. Hence, identifying the worst-performing departments in vacancies and turnover will:
* help the government _prioritize its limited resources and budget_ towards improving employee retention; 
* _reduce loss-of-productivity costs_ due to vacancies by concentrating efforts on departments with high vacancy rates;
* maximize retention of employees in departments with high turnover rates, which _reduces costs associated with recruiting and training_;
* directly address where brain drain and loss of talent hits city government agencies the hardest and consequently _raise the quality of service_ that it delivers to Baltimore residents by retaining top talent and 'know-how'.

# High-Level Findings & Suggestions

Our findings identified the top worst performing departments as the *Office of Criminal Justice, Office of Inspector General*, and the *Office of Civil Rights* by turnover and vacancy rates. Additionally, we noticed a correlation between frequent leadership changes and high employee turnover within agencies. Compared to the national metrics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for state and local governments, excluding education, Baltimore City Government consistently has a net loss of employees whereas the national trend is to gain employees.

# Provide concrete steps and/or tools for the Baltimore City team to use this information in their future work
# Mention additional department or division needs based on your findings
Our recommendation would be to focus efforts on retaining leaders and cultivating a culture of dedication/loyalty to the departments rather than to the department head.
