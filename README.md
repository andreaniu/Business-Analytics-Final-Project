# Who’s in and who’s out: Tackling how Baltimore City Government can retain its best talent 

In our business analysis, we examined the performance of each city government department to identify the worst-performing departments, enabling city government to best prioritize limited resources towards improving employee retention in that area.Our findings identified the top worst performing departments across turnover and vacancy rates, along with a correlation between frequent leadership changes and overhaul of staff.

Our recommendation would be to focus efforts on retaining leaders and developing a culture of dedication in these departments, especially the Office of Criminal Justice, Office of Inspector General, and the Office of Civil Rights. Not only are they consistently low performing but they arguably also have an extensive impact on the rest of city government and the community.

Employing and retaining the right people to carry out government functions are critical elements to ensure Baltimore City Government provides the best services to their citizens. We suspect that non optimal efficiency in any given agency is partially due to position vacancies and employee turnover, however, we don’t have a good grasp on which specific positions are difficult to fill, why it might be challenging to retain employees, and how government fairs against other industries in competing types of positions. What does the past 3 years of employee data tell us about this, and which agencies and positions are most at risk for employee high turnover rates?
	
Our Approach and Analysis
  We wanted to look at turnover rate/retention rate in different periods. Some initial guiding questions: What is Baltimore city's turnover 
  rate? What is the turnover rate per department over time? Does turnover vary by season? Are their specific jobs that show extremely high   turnover? For specific jobs and departments, how do we compare to industry standards?
Outside research

  Separation rates are a synnonym. Separation rates in 2018 for non-educational state and local governments was 20%, which is an increase
  from rates prior.
